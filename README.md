I am PÃ©ter Kaltenecker, a molecular biologist currently transitioning from wet lab work to computational biology and data science. 
Besides data analysis, my main focus is to apply machine learning methods (classification, dimensionality reduction, clustering) in translational medicine.<br>

This GitHub page works only as a repository at the moment containing scripts for the projects that I am/have been working on. 
However, most of the latest projects are not public yet.
