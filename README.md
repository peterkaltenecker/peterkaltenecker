I am PÃ©ter Kaltenecker, a molecular biologist currently working as a computational scientist. 
I moved away from wet lab work and now use bioinformatics and data science tools for different kinds of data analysis. 
Besides that, my main focus is to apply machine learning methods (classification, dimensionality reduction, clustering) in translational medicine.<br>

This GitHub page works only as a collection of repositories at the moment containing scripts for the projects that I am/have been working on. 
However, most of the latest projects are not public yet.
